* [A pretty comprehensive blog post from Dato](http://blog.dato.com/how-to-evaluate-machine-learning-models-the-pitfalls-of-ab-testing) (The link no long works, but I found [this](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/evaluating-machine-learning-models/page/6/the-pitfalls-of-a-b-testing) article). 
* [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh00PoR76NY) and [book](https://www.amazon.com/Testing-Most-Powerful-Clicks-Customers-ebook/dp/B00E1JO50M/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1497988516&sr=1-1&keywords=dan+siroker+a+b+testing) from former Googler now Optimizely CEO Dan Siroker 
(Optimizely is an A/B testing company, providing optimization for other businesses), they also have a [blog post](https://www.optimizely.com/ab-testing/) about a/b testing but this one may be more sales-ey.
* [Evan Miller' blog](http://www.evanmiller.org/) has some great articles about A/B testing, unfortunately it hasn't been updated for a while  
* A really old [article]((https://www.cennydd.com/writing/statistical-significance-other-ab-pitfalls)) but kind of funny 
  > "Last week I tossed a coin a hundred times. 49 heads. Then I changed into a red t-shirt and tossed the same coin another hundred times. 51 heads. From this, I conclude that wearing a red shirt gives a 4.1% increase in conversion in throwing heads."  
  > " ... random variation should always be the first cause considered of any change in observed results."  

* I learned about the Multi-armed bandit testing [here](http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=132)["](http://blog.thedataincubator.com/2016/07/multi-armed-bandits-2/)

* A detailed explanation of [P-values](http://bactra.org/weblog/1111.html), which is one of the most mis-understood and mis-used concept in statistics
